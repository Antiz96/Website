# Welcome!

My name is Robin Candau, also known as Antiz on the internet, I'm 27.
  
I'm a french Linux system engineer passionate by skate, music, craft (beers) and, obviously, Linux!  
This website serves as a central place to get general/contact info about me, as well as writing some [blog posts](https://antiz.fr/blog/) when I feel like it.

# Projects

I contribute to many Open Source projects and I'm always willing to help and learn in the process!  
Here are the main projects I actively contribute to:

## Arch Linux

- Arch Linux Trusted User/Package Maintainer: As part of the staff of the Arch Linux distribution, I contribute to its development by maintaining packages on Arch's official repositories. I also with the AUR (Arch User Repository) moderation. Click [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Trusted_Users) for more information.
- Arch Linux Testing Team member: My role within the Arch Linux Testing team is to install, test and verify that the packages submitted to the Arch's "testing" repositories are working as intended and without regressions nor bugs in order to validate (or not) their "promotion" to the official stable repositories (done collaboratively with the other members of the Arch Linux Testing team). Click [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_Testing_Team) for more information.
- AUR Package maintainer: In addition of maintainin packages in the official repositories (as part of my Trusted User/Package Maintainer role), I also submit and maintain packages on the AUR which is a community repository maintained by Arch users. Click [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_User_Repository) for more information.
- Various other contributions: Additionally, I contribute to the Arch wiki; I'm doing some community technical support via the forum, the IRC channels and the Arch's Reddit community; as well as financial contributions.
